  "course_description": "This instance of \"Media, Education, and the Marketplace\" focuses on the rise of information and communications technologies (ICTs) during the age of globalization, specifically examining its effect and potential in developing nations across the world. In particular, the class will focus on the following three components:\n\n*   \"Media\" \u2013 ICTs, specifically the dramatic rise in use of the Internet over the past twenty years, have \"globalized\" the world and created opportunities where very few have been available in the past. We are entering a phase where an individual can significantly improve his or her own economical, political, and social circumstances with just a computer and Internet connection. This course investigate these profound developments through current research and case studies.\n*   \"Education\" \u2013 With projects such as MIT's OpenCourseWare, the major players in the world are beginning to understand the true power of ICTs in development. Throughout this class, we examine projects that harness the benefits of ICTs to create positive social change around the world.\n*   \"Marketplace\" \u2013 The focus is on the developing regions of the world. Specifically, the term \"digital divide\" is tossed around in everyday language, but what does it really mean? Is there an international digital divide, a national digital divide, or both? Should we try to bridge this divide, and how have past attempts succeeded and (for the most part) failed? Why? These are all questions that are asked throughout this course.\n\nThis course has a very unique pedagogy, which is discussed in more detail in the [syllabus](pages/syllabus) section.\n",
